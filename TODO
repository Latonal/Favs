# Pages
- When moving a sticker to another page, the group/sticker should be put in a "bubble" available only on this page. Put parent as "-x" (page minus page number we tried to move them in) ? Or an information "in_bubble" and change the "position" information accordingly

# Group type
- Music/Video : https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:buffering

# Edit window
- To retrieve a style/theme : https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/getComputedStyle
- If a sticker become empty when closing the window, delete it

# Tutorial
- Select language
- Select default theme
    - Display Default Theme of browser at the start
- Create a cute mascot (based on a star)

# Generate Playground
- The function should have a page parameter so only one page is loaded depending of the settings (ie: at the start of the application to avoid too many elements loaded, or when loading another page)
- Ordering the results by "order" should be done when querying it, not afterward through a sort function, allowing to order albums, groups and stickers and not only stickers
- Assign a theme through css rather than attribute ? Todo later ?
- Alt to links in my-sticker tags
- When selecting if a group should be row or column (other than with even or odd), add margin-top:2px or margin-left:2px depending of it

# Interact Playground
- When moving an element, a ghost copy item should appear where we over to give a better idea to the user

# Tools / Security
- Encrypt, decrypt function -> use a localstorage to store and get the key
- Simulate error in the code and format them properly
- Create a reminder every X (100) modifications and after Y (a month) times without saving (import/export)

# Tips
- Create tips through the application
- Images
    - "You can use images directly stored on your computer by using their link, and even .svg files by copying their content!"
